After learning a lot from pygame, I wanted to test other possible functions with python: applications.
I saw that PySide6 and TKinter were made for this, so I chose PySide6.

After watching some videos/courses about Pyside6, I made a rather basic application with its help, writing notes, saving them, loading them (the note and its contents) sooo... Here's what it looks like

### Create a note 
- As you can see in the background, the notes already created are loaded.

### Open a note / write inside
- Clicking on note will open it on the right, you can then write in it or if there is already something written load it.
- You can also delete notes by pressing delete or backspace on the keyboard after selecting them.
